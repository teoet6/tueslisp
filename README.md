Year 9, 1st term project for programming classes in TUES

## Compiling
```sh
./compile.sh
```

## Running
```sh
./tueslisp
```
If the file `preload.tl` exists in the current working directory it will be loaded and executed.
Afterwards the prompt `TUES>` will appear on the screen.
the base of `tueslisp` is very minimal so I recommend you use the default `preload.tl` file.
Reading the default `preload.tl` file is currently the documentation.
